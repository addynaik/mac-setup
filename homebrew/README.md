# Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) calls itself _The missing package manager for macOS_ and is an essential tool for any developer.

## Installation

Before you can run Homebrew you need to have the **Command Line Tools for Xcode** installed. It include compilers and other tools that will allow you to build things from source, and if you are missing this it's available through the App Store &gt; Updates. You can also install it from the terminal by running the following:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
```

To install Homebrew run the following in a terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

hit **Enter**, and follow the steps on the screen.

After that you should make sure everything is working by running:

```bash
brew doctor
```

If everything is good, you should see no warnings, and a message that you are "ready to brew!".
